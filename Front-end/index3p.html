                <h2 id="h2">I am, a passionate learner who loves turning real-world challenges into creative and innovative solutions — guided by discipline, curiosity, and critical thinking.
                    I like to approach problems by uncovering their root causes and developing clear, practical solutions. I also enjoy turning complex ideas into simple, meaningful expressions.
                    I love exploring how technology and economics can work together to create meaningful real-world solutions. Beyond academics, I enjoy experimenting with tech projects, coding, and learning about science and global economic trends.

                            <h4>I have developed leadership through my active involvement in the Central Language Improvement (CLI) organization, where I contributed to planning and coordinating initiatives to enhance students’ language skills. Leading a small team taught me how to communicate effectively, make decisions under pressure, and motivate others to work toward a shared vision.
                                I also demonstrated leadership in my personal projects, such as developing a personal finance tracking website and an IoT-based smart irrigation system, where I took initiative in designing, managing, and completing each stage independently while sharing my experience with peers who shared similar interests.

                                These experiences have helped me appreciate the importance of listening to diverse perspectives, building mutual respect, and aligning efforts to achieve common goals.
